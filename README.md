# SoSImageRecog

Project Overview
Enter StockedUp: scan/enter items on a receipt to keep stock of what you have. Ideally, this would use camera to scan a receipt and go line by line to store the item into a database. Never have to remember whether you have something or not.

Upon entering a receipt, if itâ€™s a food item, you can enter the best used by date
If we go into sorting and pipelining feature later too, as to use the closest to expiration date items first
